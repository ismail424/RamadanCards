# Gerber files (often good to ignore if generated, but some keep them - I will ignore the temp ones but keep the folder if user wants)
# Since the user has a gr/ folder, maybe they want to keep gerbers. 
# But standard practice is to not commit generated files.
# I will leave gr/ alone but ignore temp files if any.
